# From the class in which N people study,
# 4 people are assigned to duty in the dining room.
# Kolya became very interested in how many ways this can be done.
# Kolya is a special boy,so immediately after the first question he had a second:
# how many ways are there to recruit a team of attendants,
# which Kolya himself will definitely get into?
# Input: 4 <= N <= 100
# Output: two numbers â€“ the number of ways to select four attendants
# and the number of ways to select four attendants, if Kolya must be among them.

# Hint: If Kolya is selected, then it remains to choose 3 people from the remaining N-1
